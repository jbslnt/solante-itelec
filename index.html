    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a college student pursuing Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). My academic focus lies in the realm of technology and its multifaceted applications. Beyond my academic pursuits, I<br> 
        am an avid book collector, finding joy in exploring diverse literary genres and expanding my knowledge base. Additionally, I possess a passion for creative expression through the art of poetry, where I engage <br>
        in the thoughtful crafting of verses to convey emotions and ideas.<br>
        <br>
        In terms of technical skills, I have acquired a foundational understanding of web development, including proficiency in HTML and CSS. Furthermore, my familiarity with Java extends my capabilities in <br>
        programming. Complementing these skills, I have engaged in UI/UX design, honing my ability to create user-centric and aesthetically pleasing interfaces.
